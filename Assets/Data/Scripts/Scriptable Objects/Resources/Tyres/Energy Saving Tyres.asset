  carModificationDescription: "Energy saving tyres are tyres that have been built
    specifically to have low levels\n of rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption,
    resulting in better fuel economy\n for motorists and a decrease in the associated
    CO2 emissions. Most major tyre\n manufacturers create energy saving tyres which
    have been designed to lower \nfuel consumption."
